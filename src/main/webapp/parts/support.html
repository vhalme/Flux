			How do I get Bitcoins or Litecoins
		</span>
		
		<br/><br/>
		To start trading you need something to trade with! We don't touch your investment funds directly, so you need to transfer them
		to the exchange service first. The easiest way to transfer funds to BTC-e is sending Bitcoins or Litecoins to BTC-e's 
		deposit wallet. You will find respective wallet addresses in BTC-e's Funds settings.
		<br/><br/>
		In case you don't have any Bitcoins or Litecoins yet, you can make USD deposits to your BTC-E account. In order to do that you need
		to register with one of payment brokers that BTC-E supports. BTC machines recommends <a href="http://okpay.com">OK Pay</a> as we accept
		OK Pay USD payments for our service fees. To deposit USD funds to BTC-E, you need to:<br/>
		1) Register on <a href="http://okpay.com">OK Pay</a><br/>
		2) Make a bank transfer to OK Pay's account in USD<br/>
		3) Make a USD OK Pay deposit from BTC-E's Funds settings<br/>
		Once you have have made a USD deposit to your BTC-E account, you can change all or part of it to BTC or LTC in our service. 
		<br/><br/>
		If you don't own any Bitcoins or Litecoins yet, the fastest and easiest way to deposit trading funds is to buy Bitcoins locally in
		your local currency and make a deposit in Bitcoins to BTC-e. To acquire Bitcoins locally in your local currency, turn to your local
		BTC exchange. If you don't know one, find one at <a href="http://localbitcoins.com/">localbitcoins.com</a>. If you live in Finland
		like we do, we recommend a swift and convenient <a href="http://bittiraha.fi">Bittiraha.fi</a>!
		<br/><br/>

			Fee deposits
		</span>
		
		<br/><br/>
		BTC machines Trade is free so far but we will start charging service fees at some point. When that happens we will start subtracting
		service fees from your service fee reserves according to the service plan you have selected. If your fee reserve balance is not enough
		for your selected service plan, we will deny trading services for your account until you top off your reserves or change your service plan.
		<br/><br/>
		You can deposit service fee reserves to your account and select your service plan in your 
		<span ng-show="user == undefined">
			account's settings.

		<span ng-show="user != undefined">
			<a href="#/account-v1">account's settings</a>.

			Frequently Asked Questions
		</span>
		
		<br/><br/>
		<b>WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOUR SERVICE?</b>
		<br/><br/>
		1. We don't take any of your trading funds, so you don't need for you to trust those to us. There's nothing for us to gain from the API keys since they don't allow fund withdrawal.<br/>
		2. Our application was designed and coded by a senior level developer with solid technical background and professional profile.
		
		<br/><br/>
		<b>HOW SECURE IS YOUR SERVICE?</b>
		<br/><br/>
		It's pretty secure. All reasonable security measures are in place such as multi-level db server protection, sensitive data hashing, encrypted connection etc.
		Basically it's not worth the effort to hack us, since we don't even store a lot of coins or any other data worth stealing.
